This website hosts some resources to help you get started with the $$\LaTeX$$
environment from scratchâ€”no programming experience needed. I was lucky enough
to be pushed to learn $$\TeX$$ by one of my professors a few years ago
(shoutout to [Jonathan Gordon](https://www.cs.vassar.edu/~jgordon/)), and the
$$\LaTeX$$ environment has served me well ever since.
